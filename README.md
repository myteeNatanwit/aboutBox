# aboutBox
AboutBox component
this is to demo the way to call aboutbox component.
1- aboutbox itself acts as a blackbox.
2-parent calls it - so the way it called is from parent side.
The aboutbox comp has its own directory, swift file and storyboard file.
The parent is an empty screen with one button. it calls the aboutboxcom as external and independent unit.
